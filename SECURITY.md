## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability that may allow:
- bypassing plugin restrictions,
- exploiting unintended mechanics for unfair advantage,
- leaking sensitive player/server data,
- crashing the server or escalating privileges —

**Please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, report it responsibly through one of the following methods:

- 🐙 **GitHub**: Submit a private report via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)
- 💬 **Discord**: `@narin4ik`

### What to expect:
- A confirmation response within **72 hours**.
- Follow-up details about whether the issue has been accepted or declined.
- If accepted, a patch will be released in the next update, and a security note will be added to the changelog (without disclosing sensitive details before the fix is available).

We greatly appreciate community efforts to help keep SCP: SL servers secure and stable.
